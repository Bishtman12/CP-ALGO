# It counts the positive integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n.
# It is the number of integers k in the range 1 ≤ k ≤ n for which the greatest common divisor gcd(n, k) is equal to 1.

# Theorem 1 : if n is prime then phi(n) = n-1
# Theorem 2 : if n = p^x then phi(n) = p^x - p^x-1 ; p is prime
# Theorem 3 : if n doesn't satisfy the above conditions then, break it into parts then apply theorem 2 and multiply it.
# Direct Formulae for finding the phi(n) = n * f(1-1/p)
# for e.g n = 36 then, (2,3) prime then phi(36)= 36*(1-1/2)*(1-1/3) = 12
